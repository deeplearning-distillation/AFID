Attention-based Feature Interaction for Efficient Online Knowledge Distillation 

We propose a simple but effective online knowledge distillation algorithm, called Attentive Feature Interaction Distillation (AFID). It applies interactive teaching in whcih the
teacher and the student can send, receive, and give feedback on an equal footing, ultimately promoting the generality of both. Specifically, we set up a Feature Interaction Module for two sub-networks to conduct low-level and mid-level feature learning. They can alternately transfer attentive features maps to exchange interested regions and fuse the other partyâ€™s map with the features of self extraction for information enhancement.
